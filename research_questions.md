## Research Question
Is there a significant difference in monthly income between employees who left the company and those who stayed?

## Variables
- **Independent Variable:** Attrition status (Yes/No)
- **Dependent Variable:** MonthlyIncome (continuous numeric)

## Hypotheses

### Null Hypothesis (H₀):
There is no significant difference in mean monthly income between employees who left and those who stayed.
- H₀: μ₁ = μ₂

### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
There is a significant difference in mean monthly income between employees who left and those who stayed.
- H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂

## Significance Level
α = 0.05 (5% significance level)

## Planned Statistical Test
Two-sample t-test (or Welch's t-test if variances are unequal)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis on income distribution
- [ ] Check assumptions for t-test
- [ ] Conduct statistical analysis
- [ ] Interpret results
